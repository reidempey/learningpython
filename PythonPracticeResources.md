# Python Practice Resources

Hi CV Guys:

At the meeting we had with Ben a few weeks ago, we talked about a couple of different resources for learning and (most importantly) practicing Python. Here is a list of a few that I am aware of.

## Project Euler - https://projecteuler.net/about
Project Euler is a list of programming/math challenges that require both mathematical and programming insight. It is language agnostic, in that you can solve the problems in whatever language you want, and then submit your answer for it to be graded. Project Euler is typically well-regarded by computer science students and many others, especially because it takes a highly mathematical approach to problems.

The one drawback to PE is that other users’ answers or code aren’t really readily accessible to see after you’ve solved it. Some people have made their answers available on GitHub and individual sites, however. Just one example is Nayuki, who is a software developer from Canada who has made all of her code examples available for others to see and critique. She publishes every solution in Java and Python, with many of the solutions in Mathematica and/or Haskell. Her site and GitHub seem to be a great resource. Her blog is also full of all kinds of cool topics related to CS, math, and art.

Nayuki’s site and blog - https://www.nayuki.io/page/project-euler-solutions  
Nayuki’s GitHub - https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions

## Practice Python - http://www.practicepython.org/
This site is similar to Project Euler, except that it only has 36 challenges, and that they tend to be more basic, and focused on the functions of the Python language. I haven’t worked through these problems personally, but they seem like a good first step, especially if the problems in math-heavy PE seem intimidating.

## finxter - https://app.finxter.com/learn/computer/science/
finxter is a platform designed to help people learn to read Python code and understand intuitively what it does. It does so with specifically designed challenges that each demonstrate a concept or component of Python. This site uses an Elo rating system, which is similar to how professional chess players are rated. Essentially, you come in to a given challenge that has a given rating, and you have your rating. If you beat the challenge, and its rating is higher than your rating, your rating goes up, and the rating on the challenge goes down. If you put it a wrong answer, the rating of the challenge goes up. It's an interesting way to go about measuring the difficulty of different challenges.

The creator of finxter also has a blog, and offers online courses on how to become a Python freelance developer. I really like a lot of his content, and would highly recommend checking finxter and his blog out, even just to get to know what is available there to you.

## CheckiO - https://checkio.org/
CheckiO takes a similar, challenge-based approach to practicing Python, but tends to not be quite as math-centric as PE. However, a huge benefit to CheckiO is that after you have solved a challenge successfully, you can browse through the many solutions that other users have submitted. Most challenges have many submissions, and there is a voting system where users can vote for which answer they like best according to different criteria, e.g. most clever, most succinct, most clear, most Pythonic, etc. Those aren’t the exact categories, but you get the idea. This is especially useful because you can see tons of different approaches to the same problem, and you can pick your poison. Is most code unclear to you? You can look for the most clear submissions, that are as explicit in their structure as possible. More interested in seeing a problem solved in as few lines as possible? You can learn new methods by looking at the shortest submissions. I would often solve a problem in around 15 lines or more, and then be blown away by someone solving the same problem with only a single line.

CheckiO is the site that I have the most experience with of all the sites on this list, and I’d recommend checking it out (pun not intended).

## Codewars - https://www.codewars.com/
Codewars is very similar to CheckiO in many ways. However, there are a few major differences. First, you can practice and see others code in many more languages (CheckiO only does Python and JavaScript). Another is that each challenge is organized by difficulty in what they call “kata”, which is a term taken from martial arts to refer to challenging exercises that are used to improve one’s skills. Each challenge, or “kata”, has a difficulty level attached to it, and as you complete harder kata, you increase your own ranking and level. You can also see others’ solutions, similar to CheckiO.

## Hiring-Focused Sites
Here are a few sites that are similar to the challenges in the sites above, but have more of a focus on showing off your skills to employers or other programmers.

### HackerRank - https://www.hackerrank.com/
Probably one of the most well-known sites for showing off your skills. It’s one of the first sites to offer challenges, and one of the first to utilize the challenge/competition approach for companies to find the talent that they're looking for.

### Triplebyte - https://triplebyte.com/
They tend to focus on how annoying it is to send resumes and do coding challenges for tons of companies, seemingly over and over. Take tests to certify your skills, solve challenges, and get hired as a developer. They also emphasize to companies how much more efficient it is to find good programmers by actually testing for the skills you want, instead of just trying to sift through hundreds of resumes.

### CodeSignal - https://codesignal.com/developers/
Used to be called CodeFights, and used to focus more on the competition of solving challenges against other coders. Now, they’ve shifted as well towards catering to tech companies looking for developers.

## Closing Thoughts
There are tons of other platforms out there. Often, you can find out what the newest services are by Googling a common site like HackerRank, and then look at the ads to see who is currently trying to compete with them, and take a bite out of HR’s market share.

If you find anything else that you find particularly helpful, feel free to add it to this thread. We’re all in the same boat:)
